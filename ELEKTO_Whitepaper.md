ELEKTO is a closed-loop, non-financial energy token created by OrganiQ Sweden AB to enable transparent, fair, and efficient energy sharing within local microgrids powered by solar, batteries, wind, biogas, and V2H/V2G systems.

## Key Features

- 1 ELEKTO = 1 kWh (produced or shared)
- Internal token – no fiat value, not tradable
- Local smart microgrid logic with EMS dashboards
- Supports solar generation, smart batteries, and V2H/V2G
- GDPR-compliant data logging and tokenization

## Smart Battery Management with Real-Time Optimization

ELEKTO ensures functionality even in low-solar scenarios through intelligent energy storage that:

- Charges batteries during off-peak/low-price hours
- Discharges strategically during expensive or high-load periods
- Optimizes usage patterns with AI-driven automation
- Reduces grid dependency and environmental impact

This maximizes both economic savings and sustainability benefits.

## Current Pilot (Sweden, Q3 2025)

A live demonstration project includes:

- 3 buildings (main villa + 2 guesthouses)
- 1 rental apartment within the villa (3 rooms + kitchen)
- 4 EV chargers (2 private, 2 guest/public with billing)
- Hybrid inverter with off-grid support
- Battery storage capacity (~50 kWh)
- Smart meters and EMS dashboards for each unit

This installation replicates the energy dynamics of a small neighborhood grid, enabling testing and modeling of future rollouts.

## Membership Model

ELEKTO offers a flexible membership model for households and EV owners connected to our local microgrid or who wish to charge at connected public chargers.  
Members can share ELEKTO tokens within the network, enabling collaborative energy usage and maximizing the benefits of local renewable production.

## Technology Stack

- Polygon-based token backend (ERC-20)
- Web-based energy management dashboard
- Smart metering and EMS integration
- Token-based billing and loyalty model compatibility
