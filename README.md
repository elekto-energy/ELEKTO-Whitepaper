# ELEKTO – Decentralized Energy System

This repository contains the official whitepapers and documentation for **ELEKTO**, a local energy-sharing model developed by **OrganiQ Sweden AB**.

The system is built around:
- Solar, wind, biogas, battery storage, and V2H/V2G integration
- Blockchain-based metering and token-based kWh distribution
- The internal $ELEKTO token, designed for non-financial, closed-loop energy sharing

## Key Features

- 1 ELEKTO = 1 kWh produced or shared
- Local microgrid with energy dashboard per building
- Smart metering and blockchain logging
- Tokens earned from solar, battery optimization, and V2H discharge
- GDPR-compliant, non-tradeable, internal-only token

## Current Demo Project

A real-world demo site is being built in Sweden (Q3 2025):
- 3 buildings (1 main + 2 guest houses)
- Solar panels and battery storage
- 4 EV chargers (2 private, 2 guest with billing)
- Smart metering and full EMS visualization
- Simulates energy sharing between neighbors

## System Components

- Polygon-based ERC-20 token ($ELEKTO)
- Hybrid inverter and V2H-compatible hardware
- Local EMS for visualization of production and consumption
- Optional wind and biogas integration

## Token Philosophy

- Not a currency
- No market trading
- Closed-loop use within local community
- Designed for fairness, gamification, and energy loyalty

ELEKTO is more than a token – it’s a step toward local, transparent, and democratized energy sharing.
