ELEKTO is a closed-loop, non-financial energy token created by OrganiQ Sweden AB to enable transparent, fair, and efficient energy sharing within local microgrids powered by solar, batteries, wind, biogas, and V2H/V2G systems.

---

## Key Features

- `1 ELEKTO = 1 kWh` (produced or shared)
- Internal token – no fiat value, not tradable
- Local smart microgrid logic with EMS dashboards
- Supports solar generation, smart batteries, and V2H/V2G
- GDPR-compliant data logging and tokenization

---

## Current Pilot (Sweden, Q3 2025)

A live demonstration site including:

- 3 buildings (main house + 2 guesthouses)
- 4 EV chargers (2 private, 2 public/guest with billing)
- Hybrid inverter with off-grid support
- Battery storage (~50 kWh)
- Smart meters and EMS dashboards (per building)

This setup simulates a small neighborhood microgrid and demonstrates practical local energy sharing – ready for future scaling.

## Technology Stack

- Polygon (ERC-20) token backend
- Web-based local energy control dashboard
- Smart metering and EMS integration
- Compatible with token-based billing or loyalty models
