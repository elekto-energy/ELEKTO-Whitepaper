ELEKTO is a closed-loop, non-financial energy token created by OrganiQ Sweden AB to enable transparent, fair, and efficient energy sharing within local microgrids powered by solar, batteries, wind, biogas, and V2H/V2G systems.

## Key Features

* **1 ELEKTO = 1 kWh (produced or shared)**
* Internal token – no fiat value, not tradable
* Local smart microgrid logic with EMS dashboards
* Supports solar generation, smart batteries, and V2H/V2G
* GDPR-compliant data logging and tokenization

## Smart Battery Management with Real-Time Optimization

ELEKTO ensures functionality even in low-solar scenarios through intelligent energy storage that:

* Charges batteries during off-peak/low-price hours
* Discharges strategically during expensive or high-load periods
* Optimizes usage patterns with AI-driven automation
* Reduces grid dependency and environmental impact

This maximizes both economic savings and sustainability benefits.

## Current Pilot (Sweden, Q3 2025)

A live demonstration project includes:

* 3 buildings (main villa + 2 guesthouses)
* 1 rental apartment within the villa (3 rooms + kitchen)
* 4 EV chargers (2 private, 2 guest/public with billing)
* Hybrid inverter with off-grid support
* Battery storage capacity (\~50 kWh)
* Smart meters and EMS dashboards for each unit

This installation replicates the energy dynamics of a small neighborhood grid, enabling testing and modeling of future rollouts.

## Technology Stack

* Polygon-based token backend (ERC-20)
* Web-based energy management dashboard
* Smart metering and EMS integration
* Token-based billing and loyalty model compatibility
