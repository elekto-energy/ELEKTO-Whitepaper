ELEKTO is a closed-loop, non-financial energy token created by **OrganiQ Sweden AB** to enable transparent, fair, and efficient energy sharing within local microgrids powered by solar, batteries, wind, biogas, and V2H/V2G systems.

## Key Features

- **1 ELEKTO = 1 kWh** (produced or shared)
- Internal token ‚Äì no fiat value, not tradable
- Local smart microgrid logic with EMS dashboards
- Supports solar generation, smart batteries, V2H/V2G
- GDPR-compliant data logging and tokenization

## Current Pilot (Sweden, Q3 2025)

A live demo site consisting of:

- 3 buildings (main house + 2 guesthouses)
- 4 EV chargers (2 private, 2 guest/public with billing)
- Hybrid inverter with off-grid support
- Battery storage (~50 kWh)
- Smart meters and energy monitoring
- Real-time dashboards per building

This setup simulates a small neighborhood grid and demonstrates local energy sharing between units ‚Äì ideal for future scaling.

## Technology Stack

- **Polygon (ERC-20)** for token backend
- Local energy control dashboard (web-based)
- Smart metering integration
- Compatible with token-based billing, loyalty models
